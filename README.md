# pyKinematicsKineticsToolbox
Kinetics and kinematics functions conveniently gathered in an installable python package

## Installation
Go to root folder and run the following command (you might need to precede it with sudo):
$ python3 setup.py install
It could be wise to copy the folder to a temporary storage directory before running the installation, as a series of files which are hard to delete are generated in the installation process.

## Use
Simply add the following line to any python code to import the functions:
from pykinematicskineticstoolbox.pykinematicskineticsfunctions import *
There is no need to add the path of the installation before importing.
